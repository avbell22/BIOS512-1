# Final project specifications

For your final project, produce a data narrative in a Jupyter Notebook. You can
use any data source you like. Highlight what's interesting in the data and
guide the reader through a short data-driven story with the data transformation
and visualization skills you've developed in this class.

The purpose of the final project is to demonstrate that you can build a data
narrative from scratch.  Your project should be reproducible in that all your
data operations and code for data visualizations is captured and transparent.

## Possible Data Sources:
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
- [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)
- [The Pudding](https://github.com/the-pudding/data)

## Requirements:
- Include all code from raw data import to final visualizations.
- Submit your project by uploading to your `BIOS512` GitHub repository.
- Include at least three visualizations.
- Include 2-4 paragraphs that tells the reader the data narrative.
- Format your writing in markdown and the style of your visualizations.
